🏗 LACE
Long-Form Artifact Construction Engine

Structured AI for serious documents.

Proposals. Technical reports. Compliance documents. Policies. Ontologies.
If it’s long, structured, and high-stakes — LACE builds it right.

🚫 The Problem

Most AI tools are built for chat.

But your work isn’t chat.

It’s:

80-page proposals

120-page technical modernization plans

Regulated compliance documentation

Structured evaluation responses

Cross-referenced, terminology-controlled artifacts

LLMs are powerful — but they are:

Stateless

Token-limited

Prone to drift

Inconsistent across sections

Weak at maintaining structure

You don’t need a smarter paragraph generator.

You need a document engine.

🧠 What LACE Is

LACE is not a chatbot.

LACE is a structured generation engine that uses AI as a component inside a controlled, stateful pipeline.

Think of it as:

A compiler-backed AI system for building large, coherent artifacts beyond token limits.

Where other tools generate text,
LACE manages artifacts.

🏗 How It Works (In Plain Terms)

LACE treats your document like a system — not a blob of text.

1️⃣ Structured Outline

Your document becomes a tree:

Sections

Subsections

Dependencies

Constraints

Each part is generated independently — but with full awareness of the whole.

2️⃣ Controlled Generation

Instead of “write the whole proposal,” LACE:

Generates one section at a time

Enforces terminology

Applies structure rules

Validates constraints

Logs changes deterministically

No hallucinated structure.
No forgotten requirements.
No silent overwrites.

3️⃣ Deterministic Apply Engine

When AI suggests content changes, LACE:

Validates the response

Applies changes at block level

Protects user-edited sections

Logs provenance

Prevents drift

It’s AI — but governed.

4️⃣ Validation & Compliance Layer

LACE can check:

Required sections present?

Terminology consistent?

Evaluation criteria addressed?

Cross-references valid?

Style alignment maintained?

This is especially powerful for:

Government proposals

Regulated documentation

Enterprise compliance

Technical architecture documents

5️⃣ Deterministic Compilation

Your final output isn’t stitched text.

It is compiled from a canonical internal model into:

DOCX

Markdown

PDF

Structured exports

Every export is consistent.
Every build is reproducible.

🎯 Who LACE Is For
Government Proposal Teams

High-stakes RFP responses that must align exactly to evaluation criteria.

Technical Architecture Groups

Large modernization plans with dependencies across sections.

Enterprise Compliance Teams

Policy frameworks that must maintain internal consistency.

Knowledge Engineering & Ontology Teams

Structured artifacts that exceed normal AI output limits.

🔍 Why It’s Different
Typical AI Tool	LACE
Generates text blobs	Manages structured artifacts
One-shot generation	Recursive section-level generation
No memory	Canonical artifact state
No enforcement	Terminology & constraint enforcement
No validation	Competency-based validation
Stateless	Deterministic apply engine

LACE combines:

Hierarchical generation patterns 

LLM_Large_Artifact_Generation_P…

Structured internal representation

Deterministic patching

Controlled regeneration

Strategy-based orchestration

In short:

It brings software engineering discipline to AI document generation.

🧱 Core Idea

LLM = Creative engine
LACE = Structural engine

Together:

Determinism meets AI.

🧪 Example Use Case

User uploads:

50 internal policy documents

10 example past proposals

A new RFP

Required evaluation criteria

LACE:

Builds a structured outline

Extracts terminology

Maps requirements to sections

Generates section-by-section

Validates coverage

Allows controlled regeneration

Compiles final DOCX

Result:

A coherent, consistent artifact — not a stitched-together AI essay.

🏁 The Vision

Most AI writing tools feel impressive.

LACE feels reliable.

It is built for:

Long documents

High consequences

Complex structure

Real-world constraints

Not novelty.

Infrastructure.
